# GonkWare
GonkWare aims to be a malware development automation tool. While very early in development at this stage, GonkWare is being developed with Defender in mind. Meterpreter shells are likely to get caught, use shell first for inital access, work your way to meterpreter if needed. See blog for further details:  https://hexxedbitheadz.com/GonkWare/
